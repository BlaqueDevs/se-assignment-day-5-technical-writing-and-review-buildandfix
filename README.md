## 6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?
Answer:
1. Replacing Formal or Technical Verbs:

Instead of: "Initiate the process."
Use: "Start the process."
Why it's better: "Start" is a common, everyday word that everyone understands. "Initiate" is more formal and less accessible.
Instead of: "Implement the changes."
Use: "Make the changes." or "Apply the changes."
Why it's better: "Implement" can sound overly technical, while "make" or "apply" are more straightforward.
Instead of: "Utilize the resource."
Use: "Use the resource."
Why it's better: "Utilize" is a needlessly complex synonym for "use."
Instead of: "Ascertain the results."
Use: "Find the results." or "Check the results."
Why it's better: "Ascertain" is a formal term that is less common in everyday language.
Instead of: "Disseminate the information."
Use: "Share the information." or "Send out the information."
Why it's better: "Disseminate" is a formal term that can be replaced with simpler, more direct alternatives.
2. Replacing Technical Nouns:

Instead of: "The interface is not responding."
Use: "The screen isn't working." or "The buttons aren't working."
Why it's better: "Interface" is a technical term that may not be understood by everyone.
Instead of: "The algorithm is calculating the data."
Use: "The computer is figuring out the data." or "The program is processing the data."
Why it's better: "Algorithm" is a technical term that can be replaced with simpler explanations.
Instead of: "The parameters are out of range."
Use: "The settings are wrong." or "The numbers are too high/low."
Why it's better: "Parameters" is a technical term that can be replaced by more accessible language.
Instead of: "The repository has been updated."
Use: "The files have been updated." or "The storage area has been updated."
Why it's better: "Repository" is a computer science term that is not widely used outside of the field.
Instead of: "The system architecture is complex."
Use: "The way the system is built is complex." or "The system is built in a complex way."
Why it's better: "System architecture" is technical jargon.
